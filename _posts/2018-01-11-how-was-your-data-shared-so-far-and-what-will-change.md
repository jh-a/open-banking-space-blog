title: How was your data shared so far, and what will change with Open Banking?

description: Why we should bury screen scraping for good and embrace the automation.

This post is written in response to [BBC: Why banks will share your financial secrets](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/business-42253051).
I will start by pointing out the inaccuraties, and then move on to illustrate how electronic consent will change things for the better.

It is obviously true that your financial history is something to be closely guarded. Saying however, that the information is available
to you and your bank only is misleading. Every time you use a credit, or debit card, that transactional information goes to one of the
payment processors such as Visa or MasterCard - this is a huge, American financial services company which indirectly holds insights into
the spending habits of approximately 720 million cardholders (if we include Visa, AMEX and UnionPay), this number bubbles up to *two billion*.

Presently, unless you're affiliated with a bank, you do not have any official ways of accessing anyone banking information. Despite that,
many companies will still offer you a service which as an input, takes your financial history? How is that possible?

### Enter Screen Scraping

Until recently, the primary way to access that information was by asking the end user for their banking username and password, logging in
using those credentials, and extracting whatever information was deemed to be valuable. This is dangerous for a number of reasons - the
chief reason being - once you share your bank login details, that is it - you've just given a stranger access to your bank account, and
they can, in theory do whatever they want. There is no way of easily revoking that, unless you change your password. Your bank might decide
that there is suspicious activity (as someone has logged in from Mongolia, or some other remote destination), and will deactivate your
online banking access. I'm confident many of you know what pains you have to go through to have that reinstated - in the best of cases
it will require a visit to the branch. In the worst - who knows - you might be locked out from your bank account for two weeks, until a
physical piece of paper arrives and you can finally unlock it.

Screen scraping provides a way for anyone to access your account - this could be a legitimate business, loaded with VC money and regulated
by the FCA, two guys in a garage hacking on the world's best banking aggregation app, or a rogue actor who is just waiting to rip you off.
There is no easy way to tell, there is no easy way to cut them off, or shut them down, and once your data is in a jurisdiction which doesn't
care, there's no way to do anything about that data being leaked, resold - you name it.

### How will this change?

How would we fix it? Firstly, you would never share your login and password with anyone - that remains your private master key, which you
reveal to no-one. Instead of supplying that information, you would visit the page of the business you wish to deal with and click on a button
which says "log in with your bank", or "connect to your bank". You would then be prompted, *by your bank* to log in with those master credentials.
Once the bank verifies that you are who you are, it will display a list of data categories, which the business is interested in. You, as the
end user can then decide if you feel comfortable with the data being shared or not. Unlike with screen scraping, only a subset of data is shared -
a subset which you agree to, and for a fixed period of time.

Once approved, the business is now issued a set of credentials which will work only for that single end user, and only for the subset of data
to which consent has been given. Those credentials work for a certain period of time, after which consent must be granted again by the user -
so there is little risk that the end user will be unaware of what is happening to their account.

Per-user per-data-scope credentials have the added benefit that they can be revoked at any time. Suppose a user decides they no longer want to
share data with a particular business - they can then visit their online banking dashboard and click a button and access will be revoked.
Similarly, if that business' IT infrastructure became compromised, the bank can then revoke consent en masse.

Last of all, all those third parties must be regulated. If they can't prove they are under the watchful eye of their national regulator, they
can't participate in the ecosystem. This significantly reduces the risk that a rogue actor can start extracting data from customers.

### When is this coming?

There are two channels which currently make this possible in the United Kingdom: [Open Banking UK](https://www.openbanking.org.uk/) and
[Teller](https://teller.io/). The former is due to make their ecosystem available on January 13th, and the latter is available right now.

### Adoption - the real issue

Despite all the hype and inflated expectations around being able to connect to your bank account, it remains to be seen whether this is
seen as added value by customers. Despite all efforts, only a tiny number of customers in the UK are willing to switch away from their bank.
This may well share the fate of Open Data APIs released by Open Banking last year - which is that no one cares and no one uses them.
